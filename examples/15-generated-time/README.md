# Example 15 - Generated Time

🌍 **English** • [Português (Brasil)](README_pt.md) • [Español](README_es.md)

Demonstrates the use of `--generatedTime` to add timestamp in generated documentation.

## Flag

```bash
--generatedTime
```

## Behavior

### WITHOUT flag
```go
// Code generated by nexs-swag. DO NOT EDIT.

package swagger
```

### WITH flag
```go
// Code generated by nexs-swag. DO NOT EDIT.
// This file was generated by nexs-swag at 2025-12-10T15:30:45-03:00

package swagger
```

## Usage

```bash
nexs-swag init --generatedTime
```

## Benefits

### 1. Tracking
```bash
# See when it was generated
head -2 docs/docs.go
# This file was generated by nexs-swag at 2025-12-10T15:30:45-03:00
```

### 2. CI/CD
```bash
# In pipeline
nexs-swag init --generatedTime
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: regenerated at $(date)"
```

### 3. Debug
```bash
# Identify old versions
grep "generated" docs/docs.go
```

### 4. Versioning
```bash
# Include timestamp in commit
nexs-swag init --generatedTime
# docs.go shows: 2025-12-10T15:30:45-03:00
```

## Timestamp Format

Uses RFC3339:
```
2025-12-10T15:30:45-03:00
```

Components:
- Date: 2025-12-10
- Time: 15:30:45
- Timezone: -03:00

## How to Run

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Use Cases

**Use --generatedTime when:**
- Automated CI/CD
- Multiple developers generating docs
- Need to track regenerations
- Debugging versions

**DON'T use when:**
- Want clean commits (timestamp always changes)
- Don't care when it was generated
- Prefer Git stability

## Tip: Git Diff

With timestamp, each generation creates diff:
```diff
-// This file was generated by nexs-swag at 2025-12-10T15:30:45-03:00
+// This file was generated by nexs-swag at 2025-12-10T16:45:30-03:00
```

To ignore in Git:
```bash
# .gitattributes
docs/docs.go -diff
```
